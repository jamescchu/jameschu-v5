The newest version of my portfolio using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to learn some ReactJS.

## Tech

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
  - Awesome React-driven static site generator
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
  - "Visual primitives for the component age," used as a styling solution with CSS
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
  - Each and every post is authored in Markdown parsed by [remark](http://remark.js.org/)

## Development

- Clone repo
- `yarn` to install npm dependencies
- Build with `gatsby develop`

## Deploy

- `gatsby build` to run production build
- Outputs to `public/` folder
