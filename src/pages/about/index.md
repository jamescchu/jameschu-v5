Hey there! I’m James, and I love to design just about anything. However you’ll probably find me as a digital product designer more often than not, but I don’t like to limit myself just yet. I have worked with various mediums from analog print work to the new digital frontier.

Currently I’m constantly put through my paces at ArtCenter College of Design, while I'm not working, I enjoy working with others and have been a teaching assistant classes for over a year now.

There’s always something new for me to explore, new people to meet, and new experiences to be had.
