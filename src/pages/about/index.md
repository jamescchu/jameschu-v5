### Hello! I'm James, a product designer based in LA.

As I work towards my BFA in Graphic Design for ArtCenter College of Design, I have developed a passion for converting seemingly complex systems into simple and intuitive solutions.

### Driven by curiosity and knowledge

While passion drives my motivation, my actions are driven by my curiosity and thirst for knowledge. Since being a child, I've always questioned things that most people don't even think about.

_How does a glass screen know where my finger is?_

The same thing is present when I design as well. Questioning the reasons behind even the smallest details. Leaving no grain of sand, unturned.

At the same time, being always on the hunt to learn different things has given me quite a range of hobbies and interests. Just ask me about my mechanical keyboards.


Currently I’m constantly put through my paces at ArtCenter College of Design, but I am passionate about turning complex systems into simple and intuitive

Hey there! I’m James, and I love to design just about anything. However you’ll probably find me as a digital product designer more often than not, but I don’t like to limit myself just yet. I have worked with various mediums from analog print work to the new digital frontier.

Currently I’m constantly put through my paces at ArtCenter College of Design, while I'm not working, I enjoy working with others and have been a teaching assistant classes for over a year now.

There’s always something new for me to explore, new people to meet, and new experiences to be had.
