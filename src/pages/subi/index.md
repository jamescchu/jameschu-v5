##Overview 
Subi is a platform that allows food lovers to visually share and discover new food choices based on their own tastes. 

The appearance of food heavily influences our perception of a tasty meal, and Subi is designed to present that upfront.

With each individual item of a restaurant’s menu presented separately, you can more accurately judge your own appetite, instead of vague expectations.

###Problem
You've just gotten a break from work, or from class, and you really want to just go out and eat something. Time and time again, you're met with the same burning question: "What _do_ I really want to eat?" You sit there, burning through Yelp!, Instagram, anything, and yet you just can't quite grasp what it is you want from looking through places and menus.

10 minutes have now passed, and you simply decide to just go to that taco truck right around the corner that you always go to instead.

People have trouble deciding what it is they want to eat, yet they want something new every once in awhile and they need to know in a timely fashion.
This is what I'd like to solve.

###Design Scenario
Below is a design scenario directed, shot and edited by myself with Rose as my lovely model. Key points of experiences to understand is that the interactions with the product are primarily designed to be used before and after a meal. This allows for an interference-free dining experience for the user which is something I wanted to respect.

##Goals 
Design a system that surfaces critical information about potential food choices that empower the user to make faster decisions.

##Focus
**Behavior Study**  
By studying the user's posture and physical limitations during important touchpoints with Subi, I was able to further enhance the user experience by designing interactions that are specifically tailored to their behavior.

**High Fidelity Prototyping**  
Having built projects with Framer in the past, I wanted to push the envelope even further, by really honing down on the micro interactions throughout the entire product experience.
 
**User Feedback**  
Documenting how people interact with the product proved extremely valuable in helping me refine and develop interactions and experiences that would otherwise be impossible to discover, allowing me to push even further than ever before.

##Idea Generation
To start off with creating a unique product, I assessed various different possible ideas and went with the one that held the most potential and opportunity.

![Idea generation](/images/s-ideas.jpg)
_50 different ideas were generated and distilled down to the top 10, and later, top 3._

![Strategic Pyramid](/images/s-ideation.jpg)
_Strategic Pyramid for the primary idea of a product which helps user discover food faster._

These early ideations were kept broad in scope while specific in goals in order to maximize possible implementations.

##Research
To be able to uniquely position a product requires research to understand what the current market offers, what the users want, and how they are currently doing it.

###Competitive research
Market competitors were analyzed and broken down into how they are currently helping users in the context of food discovery and sharing.

![Competitor Landscape](/images/s-compete.jpg)

###User Interviews
Multiple users in my target audience (ages 18–27) were interviewed to discuss their current methods, motivations, and aspirations in discovering new things to eat.

![User Interview](/images/s-interviews.jpg)

###Market Trends
Various market trends were analyzed to see the potential growth of such a product. Thankfully, there seem's to be a strong trend in current, and up-and-coming Generation Z individuals who are becoming more and more invested in food/drink spending and have a high tendency to always search for the "next big thing."

###Positioning Matrix
With all the information gathered, it seems to be in my best interest to surface critical information such as images of a particular item and it's popularity to better help users judge what may be best for their current appetite.

![Market Trends](/images/s-positioning.jpg)

##Touchpoints
Now that a direction from my research has been made apparent, it's time to craft the experience for it.

###Journey Map
To understand a user's emotional experience throughout their day, I created a journey map identifying key points of opportunity for my product to help with. Studying how people approach and walk away from their food adventures, I noticed that the time a user spends while they are sitting down and ready to eat is not what I want to interfere with, and instead, differ the experience to before and after their meal.

![Journey Map](/images/s-journey.jpg)

###Posture Studies
With these opportunities in mind, I set out to determine any physical, mental or cognitive limitations I may have during these areas. By conducting interviews with users and accompanying them on their food journey, I came to the following conclusions:

**Searching**
![Posture When Searching](/images/s-posture1.jpg)

**Eating**
![Posture When Eating](/images/s-posture2.jpg)

**After Eating**
![Posture When Finished](/images/s-posture3.jpg)

This posture study informs me that any user interactions, while they are searching for items, must be fast and easy, and offloading any heavier interactions later in the experience.

##Layout
To start visualizing the product, I needed to start organizing and understanding what is it I need or want and begin applying it appropriately.

###Information Architecture
By categorizing information, I can understand what kind of information should be presented to the user in different states of the product.

![Information Architecture](/images/s-ia.jpg)
_Early version of the information architecture_

Later revisions of the IA consist of simplifying the structure by discarding redundant information and/or features that are either out of the scope of the product or does not serve to enhance the product's value.

###Wireframes
Wireframes were first created out of pen and paper to allow for faster iterations. Multiple versions of a particular screen were created to explore different ideas. The most promising one was made into a paper prototype.

![Paper Wireframes](/images/s-paper.jpg)

The final paper prototypes were tested for its ability to communicate key information and logical flow between sequences.

![Paper Prototype Testing](/images/s-papertest.jpg)

One of the biggest revelations I had was the differentiation between "liking" an item and "saving" it. Ultimately, it serves the same purpose for the user, and thus I was only creating confusion by assigning them separate interactions.

After a few more revisions of the paper prototype, I moved onto more refined digital wireframes with some key changes:
- "Group Discovery" was ultimately scrapped as it did not serve enough value for the user's if they're already next to each other.
- "Social" features are downplayed more as it started to over-complicate what Subi is in essence, a food discovery app.

![Digital Wireframes](/images/s-wire.jpg)
_Early version of the digital wireframes_

While testing the flow and sequences of interactions, these early wireframes will be refined even further to be:
- Simplified, by reducing amount of screens between a user saving an item, and viewing details about it
- Less of a social media app by removing the dedicated "Alerts" feature
- More focused, by removing a dedicated "Restaurant" page, the user can focus more on the food itself, which ultimately matters most.

##Visuals 
The design of the product is where it becomes really intricate. With a food app that helps people discover new things, I wanted the product to feel **bold**, **vibrant** and **fun** to use. These were my 3 key design guide words which will inform the direction of my design.

![Design Explorations](/images/s-styles.jpg)
_Various Design Explorations and Experimentation_

Of course, color and typography are equally important in the grand scheme of things, and also went through various rounds of exploration.

For typography, I was looking for a typeface which had just a little bit of character in its design, while still communicating a very stable and strong presence. Looking at various weights, sizes and usages, I ultimately settled with FF Real by the great typographer, Erik Spiekermann. It had exactly what I was looking for, it's based on the classic Grotesque designs of the early 1900's but with a little more warmth to its presentation (visible in its curves and terminals compared to the colder, more mechanical, Helvetica). The tall x-height helps it with improved legibility in small sizes and it comes in a great variety of weights, simply perfect.

![Typographic Studies](/images/s-type.jpg)

The color was more of a challenge to get right. I looked at various colors and shades and ultimately decided that red is still the best choice for something a bit more appetizing, as any other color ruins the first impression of this being a food app. To my dismay, I needed to still somehow differentiate myself from other red "food" apps, while still using red in some way.

Early attempts were to mix it in with a more colorful presentation, combining various other colors to hopefully bring more punch to the red. However, it would overload the design too much and thus scrapped it. The final color choice was to instead use a secondary color to help accent the red. Purple was a great choice as it's analogous to red and works beautifully together in a gradient. To enhance the visual vibrancy of the two colors, everything else was simply monochrome at different shades of black.

##Interactions
To even further enhance the experience and make it more fun and easy to use, a lot of micro interactions were incorporated into the design. It was important not to overload the user with fancy animations and such, and thus it took a lot of trial and error to ensure everything is as seamless as possible.

I shot and recorded a video showcasing all the various screens and interactions from a prototype I created in Framer.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/247941810" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

Every element is carefully crafted to animate in a natural and seamless sequence.

###Framer 
A large portion of the app flow and interactions were created in a single Framer project. By utilizing Framer's new Design feature, I was able to create and reuse components by templating information within it from a .json file. What this means is I can create as many pages/items as I want just from adding items to a .json file instead of designing different screens with different information. This allows for every single card you see in the main carousel to have its own detailed information page and I can add more just as easily.
