###Hello! I'm James, a product designer based in LA.

As I work towards my BFA in Graphic Design for ArtCenter College of Design, I have developed a passion for converting seemingly complex systems into simple and intuitive solutions.

**Opportunities**  
There’s always something new for me to explore, new people to meet, and new experiences to be had. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:james@james-chu.com) for any opportunities, internships or positions alike.

###Understanding problems
From the beginning, as a kid, puzzles such as the Rubix Cube were favorite toys of mine as solving difficult problems was something I always enjoyed _(I hate math though)_. This mentality carries on to this day, and new challenges only prove to be all the more exciting.

###Understanding code
Programming was a natural hobby for me as it also involved heavy problem solving. From mostly trial and error by reverse engineering open source projects, I was able to learn languages such as Lua, PHP and Java with a degree of proficiency. Fast forward a decade, I have vastly expanded my knowledge and ability to understand and communicate naturally with other engineers and developers.

###Understanding design 
With my degree in Graphic Design, I have experience working with a wide variety of mediums and the precision in craft that comes with it. Utilizing the range of knowledge in theories and principles, I have become proficient in crafting designs that communicate ideas and concepts with full intention towards the final visual experience.

###Understanding empathy
Naturally I am someone who seeks to understand others. I love helping people _(except doing chores)_ and to understand their problems and frustrations empowers me to craft solutions that ultimately blend seamlessly into people's lives.

###Understanding nothing
I am aware that I still have much to know, my curiosity and thirst for knowledge expands beyond just design. Often times, even the most mundane things are taken for granted–like how do screens know where my finger is–and I love to question every little detail that I come across, to understand just that much more.
