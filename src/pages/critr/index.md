##Overview
Critr is a conceptual social media platform created and designed by myself. It is primarily focused on creating a community of designers that are sharing their work-in-progress photos or screenshot for critiques by others. 

This can help relieve creative blocks or the hassle of having to send over broken screenshots and pictures of your work to others and a lengthy explanation of your intentions, only to get it wrong.

##Goals
Improve the way how designers share and critique work-in-progress projects that:

- Streamlines the way we ask and give feedback on works.
- Fosters a rich design community that helps network and connect with others.

##Focus
**Research and Strategy**


**High Fidelity Prototyping**

**User Testing**

##Research

###Compeitor Landscape
As this is a brand new concept, the first step was to research the competitive landscape to analyze the feasability of such a platform.

`INSERT COMPETITIVE RESEARCH`

###User Interviews
Interviews were conducted with fellow design students at ArtCenter to see what their main problems and concerns are. As they themselves go through the design process rigorously everyday, they fit my target audience nicely. 

`INSERT USER INTERVIEWS`

- **Analysis**
  - They care about balance between coming up with solutions on their own, and asking others.
  - Access to quick feedback sessions are a big deal.

###Feature List
In order to not bloat the product with excessive features, I drafted a basic chart of features that we need and don't need.

`INSERT MUSCOW CHART`

###User Flow
An initial layout of my platform was developed based on anticipated features that I have decided on in the previous section, this flow will evolve over time as the project progresses.

`INSERT USER FLOW`

##Wireframes
A rough pass of digital wireframes were created to further demonstrate a user's flow through the application, as well as exploring new interactions with the newly released "3D Touch" feature by Apple on the latest iPhone.

`INSERT WIREFRAMES`

##Visual Design
With the application focused on designers and their work, I wanted the design of the app to be more subtle in order to not compete with the work of others. The design originally featured a seafoam green as it's accent color due to it's soothing nature, however this was changed to a brighter red that gave a much more vibrant and refreshing appearance.

##Prototyping
The first pass of prototyping was created using Pixate (now defunct). The primary decision to go with Pixate was simple, it was free and had a fairly easy learning curve, and when it was acquired by Google at the time, I thought it was something that would eventually reach wide adoption.

##User Scenario
To better demonstrate how the app works and interates, a short video was directed and filmed by myself to illustrate the various different devices and features that are used throughout a normal day.

##Intermission
Faster forward some time, it was time to bring this a step further. With the concept and visual design laid out, it's time to iterate and refine it further.

##FramerJS
In order to further refine the concept and design, I needed to create a prototype of higher fidelity to better simulate real world uses and interactions. Framer was chosen as a tool of choice after Pixate's sudden shutdown.

###Apple Watch
While learning Framer, I created a version of my app for the Apple Watch, which I then created a simple prototype in Framer. To further benchmark myself on the concept of "rapid prototyping", I set a limit of 3 hours to design and create a prototype of a single use case. Which was easily achieveable.

`INSERT APPLE WATCH PROTOTYPE`

###High Fidelity Prototypes
To better test the usability and design of the app, I recreated the entire prototype from Pixate to Framer and flushed out even more interactive screens along the way.

`INSERT FRAMER PROTOTYPE`

##User Testing
I conducted testing with approximately 6 individuals per "version". To avoid any bias, the users were kept different between sessions with a few overlap to test the overall progressions.

###Round 1
This was tested with a slightly modfiied version of the layout and design since the Pixate prototype, now redone in Framer with more interactions.

- **Key Insights**
  - [+] Flow feels good.
  - [-] Suggest using a Single Tap to comment, instead of Double Tap.
  - [-] Sections on Home feel confusing with same layout.
  - [-] Audio comments are confusing.

- **Assessment**
  - Tweaked and enhanced transitions between pages.
  - Refined gestures for comments and zooming.
  - Removal of Audio comments due to feature unable to be completed in time.
  - Created different layouts for each section on Home based on context.

###Round 2
- **Key Insights**
  - [+] Layout
  - [-] Wants a dedicated alert/inbox for messages and notifications.
  - [-] Project uploads are hidden and inconvinent.
  - [-] Navigating to Zoom is a little deep.
  - [-] "Undiscovered" and "Newest" section on Home feels too similar.

- **Assessment**
  - Added 2 extra tab sections, Upload and Notifications.
  - Merged Zoom and Comments into a single view.
  - Added Zoom animation instead of switching to another page.
  - Simplified sections on Home and tweaked the layouts even more.

###Round 3
- **Key Insights**
  - [+] No outstanding complaints.
  - [-] Typography can be slightly more dynamic.
  - [-] Pin reveal can feel repetitive.

- **Assessment**
  - Refined animation timings to be faster.
  - Adjusted typographic heigharchy to have a little more clarity.
