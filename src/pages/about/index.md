### Hello! I'm James, a product designer based in LA.

As I work towards my BFA in Graphic Design for ArtCenter College of Design, I have developed a passion for converting seemingly complex systems into simple and intuitive solutions.

<!-- From the beginning, as a kid, I loved both programming and design, however it never occured to me that those two passions would ever come together. Puzzles such as the Rubix Cube were favorite toys of mine as solving difficult problems was something I always enjoyed _(I hate math though)_. Programming interested me as it involved solving complex problems as well.

On the other hand, my passion for design grew out of my empathy for others. Ultimately, I love helping others _(except doing chores)_ and from hearing lots of complaints from the people around me about bad design, I really wanted to do something about it. 

Fast forward a decade and with my degree in Graphic Design, I have experience working with a wide variety of mediums and the precision in craft that comes with it. Utilizing the range of knowledge in theories and principles, I have become proficient in crafting designs that communicate ideas and concepts with full intention towards the final visual experience. -->

###Understanding problems
From the beginning, as a kid, puzzles such as the Rubix Cube were favorite toys of mine as solving difficult problems was something I always enjoyed _(I hate math though)_. This mentality carries on to this day, and new challenges only prove to be all the more exciting.

###Understanding code
Programming was a natural hobby for me as it also involved heavy problem solving. From mostly trial and error by reverse engineering open source projects, I was able to learn languages such as Lua, PHP and Java with a degree of proficiency. Fast forward a decade, I have vastly expanded my knowledge and ability to understand and communicate naturally with other engineers and developers.

With my degree in Graphic Design, I have experience working with a wide variety of mediums and the precision in craft that comes with it. Utilizing the range of knowledge in theories and principles, I have become proficient in crafting designs that communicate ideas and concepts with full intention towards the final visual experience.

###Understanding empathy
Naturally I am someone who seeks to understand others. I love helping people _(except doing chores)_ and to understand their problems and frustrations empowers me to craft solutions that ultimately blend seamlessly into people's lives.

###Understanding nothing
I am aware that I still have much to know, my curiosity and thirst for knowledge expands beyond just design. Often times, even the most mundane things are taken for granted–like how do screens know where my finger is–and I love to question every little detail that I come across, to understand just that much more.

<!-- ### Driven by curiosity and knowledge

While passion drives my motivation, my actions are driven by my curiosity and thirst for knowledge. Since being a child, I've always questioned things that most people don't even think about.

_How does a glass screen know where my finger is?_

The same thing is present when I design as well. Questioning the reasons behind even the smallest details. Leaving no grain of sand, unturned.

At the same time, being always on the hunt to learn different things has given me quite a range of hobbies and interests. Just ask me about my mechanical keyboards.


Currently I’m constantly put through my paces at ArtCenter College of Design, but I am passionate about turning complex systems into simple and intuitive

Hey there! I’m James, and I love to design just about anything. However you’ll probably find me as a digital product designer more often than not, but I don’t like to limit myself just yet. I have worked with various mediums from analog print work to the new digital frontier.

Currently I’m constantly put through my paces at ArtCenter College of Design, while I'm not working, I enjoy working with others and have been a teaching assistant classes for over a year now.

There’s always something new for me to explore, new people to meet, and new experiences to be had. -->
